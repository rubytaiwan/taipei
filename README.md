## Ruby Meetups

:point_right: <https://github.com/rubytaiwan/rubytw-reboot/wiki/Meetups>

## Data SIM Card

At [Taoyuan (TPE) (Mostly International flights)](http://www.taoyuan-airport.com) or [Songshan (TSA)](http://www.tsa.gov.tw/tsa/zh/home.aspx) airport you can buy Data SIM card from main carriers of Taiwan.

Due to the law, **you must have BOTH your passport AND your local ID or international driver license to buy one.** :disappointed:

* Passport => ~~No SIM card~~
* ID card => ~~No SIM card~~
* **Passport + ID card => SIM card!**

## Power (Socket)

Type [A][a-plug], [B][b-plug] (110V, 60 Hz).

[a-plug]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_plug.jpg

The EasyCard is available at all metro station information counters and convenience stores.

EasyCard credits are refundable (with some fees) so if you still have some credits left, remember to go to the MRT counter to apply for a refund.

**No eating, drinking and chewing gun is allowed inside the station or on the train.**
